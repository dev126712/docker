# Docker

 Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized, isolated unit called a container. This ensures applications run consistently across any environment, from a developer's laptop to a cloud production server, solving the common "it works on my machine" problem.

 A Docker image is a read-only template that contains all the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files required to run an application in a Docker container. It serves as a blueprint for creating isolated, consistent, and portable application environments.

 A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers – images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.
